             I would like to question our approach to artistic expression in the
            mass-market era, our capacity to perceive and interpret the world and
            the self, and our subsequent consciousness and freedom. I dream about
            and work for a new way of creation, interpretation and reception of
            art within an environment free of market domination, academic
            technocracy and administrative deception.<br/><br/>
            My work as an artist is focused on the problematization and
            denormalization of productivity as the main socio-temporal logic of
            our time. I do this mostly through sound: I intend to create
            situations of sonic "underload" where the listener can linger over
            reflection and contemplation. I believe in quietness, sparseness and
            simplicity to overcome the excess of information, fragmentation of the
            present, and immediacy of production, consumption and optimization of
            today's everyday life. I train myself <em> to look better in order to see,
            to listen better in order to hear</em> (Ã‰liane Radigue, "The Mysterious Power of the Infinitesimal"):
            The biggest step of my journey as an artist was to become conscious that I
            am not conscious, and to strive for being conscious.<br/><br/>
            I intend to understand and exist in the present through artistic
            creation, focusing on finding a solid ground, presence and intention
            for my creative necessities. I hope to create opportunities to
            encounter continuity, depth and meaning in this hectic world for me
            and others.<br/><br/>a
            <em>
            ...Promoting resting as a social action. We shouldn't rest to become
            blind and deaf, but to ease the opening of eyes and ears amid the
            culture of the overload and systematic growth of today's reality...
            ...If anybody is sleepy, let them go to sleep...
