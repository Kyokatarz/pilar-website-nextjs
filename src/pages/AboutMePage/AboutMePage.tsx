            Hi! My name is Pilar Miralles and I was born in Almería (Spain) in
            1997. I am a composer and sound artist based in Helsinki (Finland).
            I speak Spanish, English, a bit of French, and a tiny tad of
            Finnish. You can find my artist statement and short bio in the home
            page.

              My current artistic research project is called{' '}
              <em>
                Lingering over Sound; Compositional Solutions for Quietening
                Time
              </em>
              . In this project, I explore compositional solutions to approach
              timelessness, that is, the suspension of temporal perception, in
              music. I present quietness as my specific approach to
              timelessness. Quietness is understood here as an "underload" of
              auditory information, that is to say, I intend to create
              situations in which there is very little auditory input for the
              temporal organization to be optimally processed. Through the
              creative process of three concert-length works, I aim to
              articulate an artistic practice I name “time quietening”. These
              works are proposed as a response to a culture of acceleration,
              immediacy and informative overload: the audience is provided with
              situations of sonic “underload” to linger over reflection and
              contemplation amid the hectic everyday life.

            My instrumental work has been internationally premiered by ensembles
            and orchestras, such as the Île-de-France National Orchestra,
            Orchester im Treppenhaus, Defunensemble, Vertixe Sonora, Ensemble
            Ascolta or Norrbotten NEO. On the other hand, my electroacoustic
            work has been developed at the Nordplus intensive course IMMEDIA
            2021 in Vilnius (Lithuania), the MuteFest ’20 and ’22 at the
            Sibelius Academy (Finland), or the Festival of Contemporary Art of
            Granada’s University 2021 in collaboration with composer and
            researcher José López-Montes (Spain). I have participated in other
            important new music festivals in Europe such as Musiikin aika (Time
            of Music) 2023 in Viitasaari (Finland), the Academy of ManiFeste
            2022 at the IRCAM in Paris (France), or the VI VANG series of
            CentroCentro in Madrid (Spain). My most recent recognition was the
            First Prize of the Young Composers Award organized by SGAE-CNDM in
            Madrid (November 2023), thanks to which I will be the resident
            composer of the Spanish Musical Youth Network (JME) during the
            2024/25 season. I have collaborated as a co-teacher of the
            SuperCollider programming course organized by the Music Technology
            department of the Sibelius Academy since 2023. During 2023-24, I
            have also been invited by the Ulysses Network to join the Ulysses
            Journeys for young composers, attending composition courses at
            Viitasaari, Hamburg and Barcelona. I am currently working on a
            text-based work (the so-called <em>book</em>), and sometimes I dust
            off my flute and my collage notebook.
