        <Paragraph>
          I would like to question our approach to artistic expression in the
          mass-market era, our capacity to perceive and interpret the world and
          the self, and our subsequent consciousness and freedom. I dream about
          and work for a way of creation, interpretation, and reception of art
          within an environment free of market domination, academic technocracy,
          and administrative deception.
          <br />
          <br />
          As an artist, I am interested in the perceptive approach to creating
          situations and the literalness of perception while inhabiting them,
          their here and now. I feel that today's reality is a place where
          availability and immediacy have been absolutized. In such a reality,
          the simple fact of sitting in there and contemplating becomes
          extremely relevant.
          <br />
          <br />
          In my artistis <em>doings</em>, I question the goal- and
          future-orientation in which we are embedded and which have led us to a
          crisis of presence. My practice is approached as a source of
          continuous reflection rather than finalized products, a space to dwell
          that has found its latest creative motor in those expired objects and
          abandoned places that <em>remain</em> despite oblivion.
          <br />
          <br />
          <em>
            Time passes. Stuff withers. Things become nothing but their memory.
            And memories can only live through someone.
