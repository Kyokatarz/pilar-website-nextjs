        <Paragraph>
          I would like to question our approach to artistic expression in the
          mass-market era, our capacity to perceive and interpret the world and
          the self, and our subsequent consciousness and freedom. I dream about
          and work for a way of creation, interpretation, and reception of art
          within an environment free of market domination, academic technocracy.
          and administrative deception.
          <br />
          <br />
          As an artist, I am interested in the perceptive approach to creating
          situations and in the literalness of perception while inhabiting them,
          their here and now. I feel that today's reality is a place where
          productivity and efficiency have been absolutized (
          <em>do more, do faster, do better</em>). In such a reality, the simple
          fact of sitting in there and contemplating is so powerful,
          revolutionary even.
          <br />
          <br />
          In my pieces, I aim to question the normalization of that productive
          approach to everyday life, which causes us fatigue and distances us
          from the capacity to reconstruct ourselves as reflexive subjects. I
          create spaces to practice rest as an end in itself.
          <br />
