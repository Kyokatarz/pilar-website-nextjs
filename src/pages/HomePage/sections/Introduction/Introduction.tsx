        <Paragraph>
          I would like to question our approach to artistic expression in the
          mass-market era, our capacity to perceive and interpret the world and
          the self, and our subsequent consciousness and freedom. I dream about
          and work for a new way of creation, interpretation and reception of
          art within an environment free of market domination, academic
          technocracy and administrative deception.
          <br />
          <br />
          My work as an artist is focused on the problematization of
          socio-temporal logics, mostly through sound. I intend to create
          situations of sonic "underload" where the listener can linger over
          reflection and contemplation. I believe in quietness, sparseness and
          simplicity to overcome the excess of information, fragmentation of the
          present, and immediacy of production, consumption and optimization of
          today's everyday life. I train myself{' '}
          <em>
            to look better in order to see, to listen better in order to hear
          </em>{' '}
          (Ã‰liane Radigue, "The Mysterious Power of the Infinitesimal"): the
          biggest step of my journey as an artist was to become conscious that I
          am not conscious.
          <br />
          <br />
          I intend to understand and exist in the present through artistic
          creation, focusing on finding a solid ground, presence and intention
          for my creative necessities. I hope to create opportunities to
          encounter continuity, depth and meaning in this hectic world for me
          and others.
          <br />
          <br />

            ...Promoting resting as a social action. We shouldn't rest to become
            blind and deaf, but to ease the opening of eyes and ears amid the
            overload of todayâ€™s reality... ...If anybody is sleepy, let them go
            to sleep...

          consciousness.
